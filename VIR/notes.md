# Teilversuch 1

Eimer in größere Eimer stellen. Innere Eimer bis zum Rand mit Wasser füllen. Fläsche mit Spülmittel ins Wasser tauchen. Aus dem Eimer herausfließendes Wasser in größerem Eimer auffangen. Umfüllen im Messbecher. 

650 +- 50 cm^3 -> Gewicht von Spülmittel 

Höhe des Wasserpegels auf Spülmittelfläsche markieren. Foto machen. Mit Computer die Höhe von Wasserpegel bestimmen. 

-> Volumen von Spülmittel

-> Dicht

Cus the bottle is curved at the side, to reduce the error due to the bottle curvature acting as a lens, we chose to observe from the side, where the bottle was flat. 

# Video Analysis
The videos are analysed using tracker at 60 fps and the diameter of the bubbles are measured with the in built measuring tape for 3 measurements along different axis. The average is then taken. 

The video clips were geschnitted using ffmpeg automated with python before putting into Tracker in order to reduce the number of frames loaded. If the number of frames loaded is too high, tracker tends to mbe very slow and unusable, so this step is necessary.

# Cold
The bottle was then put in a freezer (due to time constraints) for 2 hours until the desired temperature ~5 deg C was reached

It was noted that the bubbles formed more of the umgedrehte Tropfen shape. the top circular part of the tropfen is then taken to be the blase

Um setup zu verbessert -> Schwarze Hintergrund


# TV2

Balls are supposed to reach terminal velocity, due to limitation in resources, no such balls / containers were available. 

Diameter: 12.7 +- 0.1 mm

Source of error: Balls should be dropped as close as possible to the surface -> Nicht gemacht 
-> Due to time constraints, Versuch nicht wieder gemacht 

position data was only sampled after the bubble caused by the entry of the ball into the fluid has collapsed behind the ball

127 +- 3 g for 15 balls

With the mass -> Terminal Velocity (has it reached terminal velocity)
